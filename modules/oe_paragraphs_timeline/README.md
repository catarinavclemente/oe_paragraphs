OpenEuropa Paragraphs Timeline
==============================

This module provides the Timeline paragraph that depends on the [OpenEuropa Content Timeline Field](https://github.com/openeuropa/oe_content/tree/master/modules/oe_content_timeline_field)
component.

The paragraph displays concurrent and/or sequential items visually on a time axis.
